# Ozone - The 'Distro' Project
>_The enterprise-grade health information system that augments OpenMRS 3._

This is the official Maven project for the free and open-source software flavour of Ozone, aka **Ozone FOSS**.
This Maven project makes it easy to build and package Ozone FOSS.

:bulb: **Did you know?** There is a *pro* flavour of Ozone, aka **Ozone Pro**, that adds a number of enterprise features to Ozone FOSS.

## 1. Overview
A **Maven project** that gathers all artefacts that make the **FOSS distribution of Ozone**.

It depends on the OpenMRS 3 distro Ref App
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.openmrs.distro</groupId>
  <artifactId>referenceapplication-package</artifactId>
  <type>zip</type>
</dependency>
```
and then _augments_ OpenMRS 3 with all components that make Ozone FOSS a fully integrated health information system.

Building it fetches and brings in one place all Ozone's artifacts, simply run:
```
mvn clean package
```
